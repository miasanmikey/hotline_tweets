Hotline Tweets - Mental Health help hotline numbers published to twitter
==================================================================

Hotline Tweets is a Python/Tweepy based program that tweets Mental Health hotline numbers for various demographics. The focus of the Hotline Tweets program is to provide readily available access to a running list of hotline numbers. For now tweets fire off every 4 hours.  

For now the program is fairly basic and static (push a line from a .txt to twitter).  A project page has been set up and we will work on that moving forward.

This project will remain open source.  Feel free to contribute!
